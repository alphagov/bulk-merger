# Bulk merger

Bulk merge Pull Requests for MoJ repos.

Forked and modified from [alphagov/bulk-merger](https://github.com/alphagov/bulk-merger)

## Setup

Create a "Personal access token", with at least the `repo/public_repo`
scope. Ensure this PAT has SSO authorisation for the `ministryofjustice` organisation. Add your token with repo access to `.env`:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<yourtoken>
```

The scripts will use this token to talk to GitHub.

## Bulk approve PRs

```
./review modernisation-platform actions/checkout
```

This looks for unreviewed PRs in repos containing `modernisation-platform` with "actions/checkout" in the title. If it finds any, it will list them out and ask you to confirm if you want to approve them.


```shell
$./review modernisation-platform checkov-action
Searching for PRs containing 'checkov-action' in repositories whose name contains modernisation-platform
Found 1 unreviewed PRs:

- 'Bump bridgecrewio/checkov-action from 12.2150.0 to 12.2151.0' (https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-terraform-module-template/pull/49)

## Approve & merge all Pull Requests

```
./merge modernisation-platform actions/checkout
```

This will run the `./review` script above, but also merge the approved PRs.

Because all repos have [branch protection turned on](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/configure-github-repo.html), you won't be able to merge PRs that haven't passed on CI.
